  ### Security

  >[!WARNING]
  >Do not put this on the Internet if you do not know what you are doing.

  By default this container has no authentication and the optional environment variables `CUSTOM_USER` and `PASSWORD` to enable basic http auth via the embedded NGINX server should only be used to locally secure the container from unwanted access on a local network. If exposing this to the Internet we recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy, such as [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), and ensuring a secure authentication solution is in place. From the web interface a terminal can be launched and it is configured for passwordless sudo, so anyone with access to it can install and run whatever they want along with probing your local network.
